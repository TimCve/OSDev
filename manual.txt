command : chain
________________________________________________________________________________
DESCRIPTION:
A program for chaining together other programs. Can also be used
to print out strings and perform conditional operations.

OPTIONS:

Basic command chaining:

    > chain $program1$program2$program3

will execute program1, program2 and program3 in that order.

Printing strings:

    > chain $"Hello"

will print "Hello" to the screen (can also be used in combination with running
programs).

Conditional jumping:

!!! NOTE !!!
A program returns a 0 if it runs properly
A program returns a 1 if it encounters an error
An attempt to run a non-existant program will return a 2

    > chain $drive 1$~0:4~$"don't print this"$"print this"

will only print "print this" if drive 1 exists (drive 1 command returns a 0).
The syntax is ~x:y~ where x is the exit status that you are checking for
and y is the index of the statement you are jumping to if that status is
returned. Statement indexes start at 1. This command will print both
"don't print this" and "print this" if drive 1 is absent.

Unconditional jumping:

    > chain $drive 1$@4@$format$drive 0

will go to drive 1, skip the third statement and go straight to the fourth.
Syntax is @y@ where y is the index of the statement you are jumping to.

EXAMPLE USAGE:

    > chain $drive 1$~0:4~$~1:6~$"drive exists"$@7@$"drive absent"$"done"

will print "drive exists" "end" if drive 1 exists and will print
"drive absent" "end" if drive 1 is absent.
